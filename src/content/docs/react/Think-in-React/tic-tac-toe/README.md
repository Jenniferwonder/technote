# 02-Tic-Tac-Toe

## Build _Tic-Tac-Toe_

### ![](./z-Assets/Demo-tic-tac-toe.png)

## 📌*Square*

### Display the value of each square

### Respond to Click event

## 📌*Board*

### 🛠️Store Array in `useState`

- To store 9 squares value (X/O) in state
  - `const [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));`

### ✅Update the squares array with `handleClick(i)` function

- 🛠️Store Boolean in `useState`
  - To decide the value of next move
    - `const [xIsNext, setXIsNext] = useState(true);`
- ✅Create a copy of the squares array
  - call `.slice()`
  - `const nextSquares = squares.slice();`
  - 📌Immutability is important
    - Immutability makes complex features much easier to implement.
      - “time travel” feature
    - skip re-rendering a part of the tree that clearly wasn’t affected by it for performance reasons
      - By default, all child components re-render automatically when the state of a parent component changes.
    - how React chooses when to re-render a component
      - https://react.dev/reference/react/memo
- ✅Take turns
  - Use `xIsNext` and assign value to the copied array
    - `xIsNext ? (nextSquares[i] = "X") : (nextSquares[i] = "O");`
  - Prevent the X being overwritten by an O
    - check if X/O exist, if true, return

### ✅⭐Declare winners

- Use _calculateWinner_ function (using a 2d-array)
  - Store all possible winning cases
- Add the function result to the _preventing statement_ (in Take turns)
- Display winning message
  - String concatenation
    - `status = "Next player: " + (xIsNext ? "X" : "O");`

### Render Board value

## 📌*Game* > _Index.js_

### Add time travel

- ✅Lifting state up, again
  - write a new top-level component called _Game_ to display a list of past moves
- Control squares state in Game
  - Store the past _squares_ arrays in another array called _history_ as a new state
    - `const [history, setHistory] = useState([Array(9).fill(null)]);`
    - It represents all board states, from the first to the last move
  - 🛠️Render the last move from the history
    - `const currentSquares = history[history.length - 1];`
- 🛠️Add function `handlePlay` to update the game
  - It will be called by the Board component to update the game
  - Pass `xIsNext`, `currentSquares` and `handlePlay` as props to the Board component
  - update `history` by appending the updated `squares` array as a new history entry
    - `setHistory([...history, nextSquares]);`
  - Update `xIsNext`
    - toggle `xIsNext`, just as Board used to do
      - `setXIsNext(!xIsNext);`
- ✅Display moves history as buttons
  - use `map` to transform your `history` of moves into React elements representing buttons on the screen,
    - `history.map((squares, move) =>{}`
    - Render button description for each move
      - move > 0
        - `description = "Go to move #" + move;`
      - else
        - `description = "Go to game start";`
    - Unique ID for each list of button
      - it’s safe to use the move index as a key
        - `<li key={move}> </li>`
      - 📌Avoid _key_ error
        - If no key is specified, React will report an error and use the _array index_ as a key by default.
          - It is problematic when trying to re-order a list’s items or inserting/removing list items
        - Keys do not need to be globally unique; they only need to be unique between components and their siblings.
  - Define button function to update `currentMove`
    - keep track of which step the user is currently viewing
      - `const [currentMove, setCurrentMove] = useState(0);`
    - `<button onClick={() => jumpTo(move)}>{description}</button>`
    - Add _jumpTo_ function inside `Game`
      - update that `currentMove`
        - `setCurrentMove(nextMove);`
      - set `xIsNext` to true if the number that you’re changing `currentMove` to is even (偶数)
        - 🛠️`setXIsNext(nextMove % 2 === 0);`
        - ✅`const xIsNext = currentMove % 2 === 0;`
- ✅Modify _handlePlay_ function
  - If you “go back in time” and then make a new move from that point, you only want to keep the history up to that point.
    - add it after all items in `history.slice(0, currentMove + 1)` so that you’re only keeping that portion of the old history.
      - `const nextHistory = [...history.slice(0, currentMove + 1), nextSquares];`
  - Each time a move is made, you need to update `currentMove` to point to the latest history entry.
    - `setHistory(nextHistory);`
    - `setCurrentMove(nextHistory.length - 1);`
- ✅Render the currently selected move
  - modify the `Game` component
    - `const currentSquares = history[currentMove];`
