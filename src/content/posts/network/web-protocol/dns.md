### Domain
Domain is a place on the web where you can store your files.  
Each domain would have a unique IP address which is used to identify it.  
All domains were connected to a single large server called **DNS server** which is then connected to your browser through the internet.  
To improve the response time, the DNS are split into many branches  
and put all around the globe and are inter-linked with each other.
