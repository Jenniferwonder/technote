## Intro

### Best Practices

- Avoid including implementation details.
- Final users will have no notion of React. Rather than dealing with instances of rendered React components, your tests should wok with actual DOM nodes.
- Resemble software usage
- Maintainability in the long run - as long as you're not changing functionality any changes in the implementation of the component won't break your tests and slow you and your team down

### Why Testing?

- Discover defects or bugs before delivery to the client
- Guarantee the quality of the software you develop further by catching bugs before they find their way into a live application
- Reduce user complaints and save time and money

## Jest

### Two tools React endorses to structure your tests.

### Good iteration speed

### Powerful features, like _mocking_ modules so you can have more control over how the code executes, to make sure your unit testing is standalone.

### A JS test runner that lets you access an artificial DOM called jsdom. While jsdom is an approximation of how the browser works, it's often good enough for testing React component.
