[Getting Started | Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)

## Why Vite?

Vite has several advantages:  
Fast development builds: Vite uses the native ES modules feature in the browser to handle imports, which allows for faster development builds and hot module replacement. This means that you can see your changes in the browser instantly without having to wait for a full build process to finish.  
No configuration required: Vite does not require a configuration file, which can save developers a lot of time and hassle. Instead, it uses conventions and sensible defaults to handle the build process, which allows developers to focus on writing code rather than configuring the build process.  
Easy to use: Vite is designed to be easy to set up and get started with, and it has a simple command-line interface that makes it easy to use for developers of all skill levels.  
Built-in development server: Vite has a built-in development server that automatically reloads the browser when you make changes to your code, which makes the development process even more efficient. Excellent documentation: Vite has excellent documentation, which makes it easy for developers to learn how to use it and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
