# Build a Filterable Product Table

### Step 1: Break the UI into a component hierarchy

#### Splitting up a design into components

- ![split-up-design](https://react.dev/images/docs/s_thinking-in-react_ui_outline.png)
- Start by drawing boxes around every component and subcomponent in the mockup and naming them.
- each component matches one piece of your data model

#### Different Approaches

- _Programming_â€”use the same techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or object. One such technique is the [single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle), that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.
- _CSS_â€”consider what you would make class selectors for. (However, components are a bit less granular.)
- _Design_â€”consider how you would organize the design's layers.

### Step 2: Build a static version in React

#### build a version that renders the UI from your data model without adding any interactivity

- Building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking
- adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing
- ðŸ“Œ`StaticApp.jsx`

#### don't use state at all to build this static version
- State is reserved only for interactivity

#### top down
- For simpler examples

#### bottom-up
- For larger projects

#### _one-way data flow_

- the data flows down from the top-level component to the ones at the bottom of the tree

### Step 3: Find the minimal but complete representation of UI state
- The search text
- The value of the checkbox
### Step 4: Identify where your state should live

### Step 5: Add inverse data flow

- ðŸ“Œ`ProductApp.jsx`
